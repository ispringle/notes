## Welcome to my world.

This is the website of Ian Pringle. I am a [particular
Baptist](particular-baptist.md) living in the sticks of Missouri with my
gracious wife and four feral children. I am a software developer by trade,
currently working with web-components and vanillaJS. Outside of my 9-to-5, I am
a tinkerer, farmer, mechanic, builder, and cowboy.
