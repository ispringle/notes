Here you can find a list of my "posts". For me a "post" is some form of prose
which is written at a specfic point in time and likely remains unchanged after
being published. Some changes might occur to correct issues like grammer,
spelling, links, etc., etc. however a post will largely remain unchanged after
being published. Posts will generally be set in a moment in time, such as "I
did or thought this thing". You can think of "posts" as being akin to a "blog",
except I just dislike the word "blog" and want this website to be more than
just "another blog".
